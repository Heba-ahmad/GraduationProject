# 123 dp free

123 Designing and Programming Free Tutorials, my graduation project was a platform of a web application, programmed by ASP.NET web development tool with C# language. It provides an instructive tutorials for learning programming languages and web/graphic designing in an easy way.

## What is 123dpFree:

 **123dpFree** is a type of Educational Website in which Tutorials will be offered lessons based on their skills level; concerned with teaching computer programming, and designing with an easiest way in no time that makes learning more fun for everyone step by step. Plus free access to information and resources that is current, well organized, and easy to understand; to give them the answers they need and to increase their information besides to enhance their background.
 Also I intend to include a short useful introduction and explanation in a simple way of some "programming languages, & web/graphic designing …etc"; which one is easy to cope with and understand quickly, environment (like which program should be better use to each language), some tutorials with pictures illustrate how to build a program or design step by step and so on… The ultimate goal of this site is of course primarily to the multiplicity of demands on these areas as well as it serves the labor market. And I hope to see such subjects increased, especially in our Arab society what gets them promoted in programming somehow.
 The website could be very useful for training institutes, and for students who want a self-learning institute or without sessions.


## How does 123dpFree work?

   My website is written in ASP.NET and C#, An ASP.NET file is just the same as an HTML file; An ASP.NET file can contain HTML, XML, and scripts, Scripts in an ASP.NET file are executed on the server An ASP.NET file has the file extension ".aspx" When a browser requests an HTML file, the server returns the file. When a browser requests an ASP.NET file, IIS passes the request to the ASP.NET engine on the server.
   The ASP.NET engine reads the file, line by line, and executes the scripts in the file. Finally, the ASP.NET file is returned to the browser as plain HTML.


Note the three roles involved in such a transaction:
User: The transaction starts and ends with the user. The user operates the web client software and interprets the results.
Web client: This is the software program that the person uses to interact with the web application. The client is usually a web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox.
Web server: This is the software program located on the server. It processes re-quests made by the web client.

The website can be accessed through any Web Browser (Fire Fox, Internet Explorer …etc) using a URL such as: http://www.123dpfree.com, a user either he was a visitor or member can browse any of the contents of my website and can read the Tutorials and download them any time … but he can't comment, rate, or add favorite tutorials to his favorite box to read them later unless he was a member …
Users can access the website through the Internet; so they just only need a PC or Laptop with Microsoft windows 2000 compatible, means that win-XP and win vista operating systems works plus  Internet (Internet Explorer or Firefox Browser)...


## The system works as follows:

(i)	Access (Home Page)
        The website can be accessed through any Web Browser using a URL such as:
         http://www.123dpfre.com

(ii)	Access (Website Contents) as a  guest
       The guest/visitor can access any of the website contents such as Tutorials, References, the Chat and etc… But he can't comment/rate or add the favorite tutorials that are given in the website to his Favorite Box if he wants to read them later …

(iii)	Access (Website Contents) as a  Member
        The Member can access any of the website contents such as Tutorials, References, the Chat and etc …   he can also Comment, Rate , and add the favorite tutorials that are given in the website to his Favorite Box if he wants to read them anytime he wants …

(iv)	Access (Login page)
       The system can be accessed through any Web Browser using a URL such as:
         http:://www.123dpfre.com /login.html

(v)	Validation process (To the Member and a New Member)
       The system identifies a user by the registered user ID and password. Usually, user ID is the member name in his/her member ID card, password is his/her member ID number. If the system cannot identify the member, it will allow him to retry but for only a maximum of three attempts.


## Tables in the database

The database used in my website contains four main tables:
- the UserRegister, contains all the pre-calibrated items of information, such as UserName, Password, Email, Security Question & Security Answer.
- MemberID table, contains all the relevant member information such as; the UserID, Password and UserName.
- MemberTask table, contains AddComment, Rate, and AddToFavotirBox.
- Contents table, it contains the IDs of Tutorials (TutsID and RefName),

## for building the system
   In my project, I used the ASP.NET and C# to build the front pages and Microsoft SQL 2005 for the database. The advantage of using ASP.NET is that ASP is an open, compile-free application that can combine HTML, Java scripts, and reusable ActiveX server components to create dynamic and powerful Web pages. In this website, it uses C# to write ASP pages, and also uses ActiveX Data Object (ADO) and OLEDB (Object Linking and Embedding Database) to connect a database that is built with Microsoft SQL 2005.

## Prototyping

The aim of my website is to provide an easy way to learn programming via simple tutorials through the internet. So the design is based on these ideas. The prototype was developed to cover these features. The prototype covers front pages and also back-end programmes, such as the ASP.NET & C# program and database.
